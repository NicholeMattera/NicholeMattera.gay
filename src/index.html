                                    As the co-chair of the GSRM affinity group at Pendo I helped plan out monthly meetings, and events with our community. I also aided in educating Pendozers both in and outside of the group on important GSRM issues, such as daily slack posts for Transgender Awareness Week, Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week, and much more. Being a co-chair also made me part of Pendo's Diversity Advisory Board, where I would advocate for changes not just for the GSRM group, but for other minority groups as well.

                                    I came in at the tail end of a project to be able to subscribe to account and visitor reports. Even then I was able to help out on the final finishing touches on the email templates to get it ready for release. After that I was apart of the team that worked on Core Events. We were able to introduce a major new feature to the platform, just in time for the companies annual event Pendomonium.

                                <p>During a recent customer visit with MGIC in Milwaukee I met with their CIO, Greg Chi. While he had many positive things to say about the team, he specifically cited the contributions and accomplishments from Nichole. From Greg's comments it became clear Nichole has delivered the perfect trifecta: collaborative spirit, unrelenting dedication and expert thinking to exceed MGIC's expectations to replace a Salesforce application with a mobile solution.</p>
